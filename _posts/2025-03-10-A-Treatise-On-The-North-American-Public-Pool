  <h1>A Treatise On the North American Public Pool</h1>
 </header>
 <main>
  <p>The North American public pool. A staple of many small town and big city childhoods, where we learned how to sink, how to swim, and how to walk catiously across the pool deck. The North American public pool was a constant location for me; growing up in swim lessons or on the swim team meant I committed hundreds of hours to the water each year. Now, as a lifeguard at my local community centre and as an assistant coach to my former team, I am no longer a participant in the pool, but rather a facilitator of childhood magic. This informal treatise of the North American public pool explores these relationships, as community centres like my own exist as, in my opinion, one of the few truly public spaces in society.</p>
