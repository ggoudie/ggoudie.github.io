  <h1>A Treatise On the North American Public Pool</h1>
 </header>
 <main>
  <p>The North American public pool. A staple of many small town and big city childhoods, where we learned how to sink, how to swim, and how to walk catiously across the pool deck. The North American public pool was a constant location for me; growing up in swim lessons or on the swim team meant I committed hundreds of hours to the water each year. Now, as a lifeguard at my local community centre and as an assistant coach to my former team, I am no longer a participant in the pool, but rather a facilitator of childhood magic. This informal treatise of the North American public pool explores these relationships, as community centres like my own exist as, in my opinion, one of the few truly public spaces in society.</p>
 <h5>The Pool in the Public Sphere</h5>
  <p>The North American public pool is one of the last true community spaces. Even behind a paywall barrier, and my local pool has a pretty steep membership fee, the pool is an open and accessible location for families and adults alike. The pool is open 7 days a week, between 12-14 hours a day, closing at most for two hours when we host swim lessons for kids. We host lane swimmers in the morn, retirees at noon, families in the afternoon, and swim team in the evening, possibly averaging 300 regulars each week in my town of 8,000. But this North American public pool is defined by more than numbers; here, I witness unquantifiable interactions between young kids, parents, and general swimmers.The pool is first and foremost a social location, moreso than the store or school or even, arguably, church. </p>
 <h5>The Pool as Polluter</h5>
  <p>The North American public pool is also a polluter.
