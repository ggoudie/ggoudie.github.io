<h1>Welcome to The Bucket</h1>

<h3>(It's giving Krusty Krab.) </h3>

<p>Welcome to my blog, aptly named The Bakeapple Bucket (The Bucket, for short). You can already read the *why* behind this name on my homepage, so in this post, I'll dive into the *why* behind this blog's creation in the first place.</p>

<p>This blog is a result of two key issues:</p>
    
<p>1. My office job is <i>kind of</i> boring, and I mean the type of boring where there's little to no work to do and my boss acknolwedges this. Trust, I do work when there is work to be done, but we're currently in a seasonal lull and my emails are drier than the West Coast in the summer. So, this blog gives me something to do when I'm at my desk.</p>

<p>2. I've started learning how to code, as a result of key issue (or should I say opportunity) 1. There is no better way to learn than by doing, and so this blog is made possible by Jekyll through my GitHub account (I don't know if that even makes sense), a variety of internet tutorials, and my <b>limited</b> skills.</p>

<p>Learning to code and design websites is honestly very out of character for me. Coding has always been a very abstract concept to me, something that I've resisted because computers and technology are "too complicated" for my non-STEM inclined brain. However, at this undefined point in my life, I realized that I have to diversify my skill set, especially if I want to work seasonally for a couple of years. While coding and website design <em>are</em> oversaturated fields, as you can tell when looking at remote positions on LinkedIn's "job" tab, developping these competencies will at least allow me to pursue my own projects. This blog in particular is a great launching pad into freelance writing (catch me in <i>The Walrus/<i> in a couple of years). Ultimately, my goal is to save/earn enough to be able to financially support myself while circumsailing the globe... (Do I know how to sail? No. Do I know how to dream big? Obviously). </p>

<p>Evidently, I'm excited to see what, if anything, this blog evolves into. I'd like to use it both as a platform to discuss the impact of climate change on cultures around the world, and also as an outlet for my poetry and plans for the future. But maybe it will devolve into memes and periodic life updates. 
    
    Only time will tell. </p>
