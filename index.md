## Welcome to The Bakeapple Bucket

<body>
<p>Your one shop stop for the musings of a nineteen-year-old girl on what love means, the imminency of the climate crisis, and the unravelling of our social make-up.</p>
  
<p>But... what do <i>bakeapples</i> have to do with this?</p>

<p>Bakeapples, or cloudberries, are a native berry to my home province of Newfoundland and Labrador. You harvest them in late summer from boggy terrain. But with rising temperatures and decreased precipitation afflicting northern Labrador, the bakeapples struggle to grow. No more quiet afternoons with my grandparents, the soft plop of each orange bakeapple in the plastic salt beef bucket. The bakeapples are another blighted victim of the climate crisis, along with hundreds of moments (and hundreds of recipes) lost along the way.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
